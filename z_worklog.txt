Note for next day

20 Dec 2022
Not working on this now. Moving to use the boiler plate at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-boring-to-beautiful#7
Completed one is in github code final folder. But will do it after the API is ready for testing.
And will use a new repo as strating fresh.
This one is the one created fresh from scratch. Quite a lot of work but good learning which I can use in the next fresh work.

Dont focus on appbar or drawer for now. Just focus on the next ones.. like background task etc.
Prioritize all platform features, take mobile only or web only features later.

Fix the app to beworking on android. Preesntinly it is not working.. This may cause a lot of problem later.
